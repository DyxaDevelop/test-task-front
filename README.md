# Task 

We create mobile applications and sometimes we have to run AB tests to test hypotheses. To do this, we need a system that is the simplest REST API, consisting of one endpoint.
## API and distribution

At startup, the mobile application generates some unique client ID (which is saved between sessions) and requests a list of experiments by adding the Device-Token HTTP header. In response, the server returns a list of experiments. For each experiment, the client receives:

  Key: the name of the experiment. There is some code in the client that will change some behavior depending on the value of this key 
  Value: string, one of the possible options (see below)
It is important that the device falls into one group and always remains in it.

## Experiments
1. Button color
We hypothesize that the color of the "buy" button affects the conversion to a purchase.
Key: button_color
Options:
  - #FF0000 → 33.3%
  - #00FF00 → 33.3%
  - #0000FF → 33.3%


So after 600 requests to the API with different DeviceToken, 200 devices should receive each color2.Purchase cost
We hypothesize that a change in the cost of an in-app purchase may affect our profit margin. But in order not to lose money in the event of an unsuccessful experiment, 75% of users will receive the old price and only on a small part of the audience we will test the change:
### Key price
Options:
  - 10 → 75%
  - 20 → 10%
  - 50 → 5%
  - 5 → 10%
## Requirements and Limitations
If the device once received a value, then it will always receive only that value.
The experiment is carried out only for new devices: if the experiment was created after the first request from the device, then the device should not know anything about this experiment
## Task
- Design, describe and implement an API
- Add experiments (1) and (2) to your app
- Create a page for statistics: a simple table with a list of experiments, the total number of devices participating in the experiment and their distribution between options
Any technology and libraries can be used

### As Advantage will be:
- Availability of tests
- Deployed version of the application
- Server response speed <100ms
- The table is powered by React with the ability to sort and filter by columns

 
## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
